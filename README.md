## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to produce a multiple-line graph to reflect the weekly fares for each type of individual city; urban, suburban, and rural. After each type of city was broken down by category, we evaluated the ride count, average fare per ride and average number of drivers. In addition, we created a comparison for each cityâ€™s metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For the purpose of this analysis, we generated a summary data frame to organize the total rides, drivers and fares along with the average fare per ride, fare per driver and the multiple line plot. 

## Results
As a result of the summary data frame, we can conclude that there is a trend between the total number of rides and the size of the population in a city. This has a direct affect on the total number of drivers, total fares and the average of both. While the more populated and urban the area the total number of rides, drivers and fares increase, the average fare per ride and driver seems to decrease. We can confirm this conclusion by the clear accessibility of rides and drivers within these rural areas. The limited amount of drivers in these rural areas will likely lead to a higher average fare per ride and per driver, as prices increase when the supply is low.

Over a period of five months we are able to evaluate the total fares as they relate to each type of city with the multiple-line chart shown below. As we can see from the multiple-line chart, the number of rides appear to increase during the end of February and varies thoughout the month of March. With the exception of the trend in suburban areas, where it shows a quick increase during the month of April, all the graphs reflect the same trend.

## Summary
Due to the fact that total fares increase as they relate to city type during the month of April in suburban cities, the company should begin take steps to discover the cause of this increase. 

Furthermore, from the data we can see that the average fare per ride and driver is higher when there are less drivers. With this conclusion, the company can influence ride-share prices by llimiting or increasing the amount of drivers during specific times to reach its financial goals.

Finally the average fare per ride tells us that there is a gradul increase from more populated areas to less populated areas. Although, the average fare per driver increases significantly when following the same trend. This result shows that the number of drivers may be substantially lower than originally expected. As a suggestion moving forward, the company may want to reorganize and redistribute more drivers to rural areas to elevate profits.
